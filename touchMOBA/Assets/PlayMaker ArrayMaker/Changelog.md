- easySave addon HashTableEasyLoad action  
- texture usage in EasySave sample to use it's own texture set to read write properly.



###0.9.8
**Issue**  
- removed undo when adding proxies to selection, just not finding the right way to do a consistent behavior... and it created obsolete warnings on 4.x

**New**

**Fix**  
- fixed null values display in inspector for arrayList nad HashTable.

###0.9.1
**Note:** **_Breaking Build_**. NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS  
Many actions public interface changed, so you will need to re-assign setters and getters on all of them.   
This version is a huge improvment in terms of ease of use, with now much more comprehensive and logical actions interfaces, no more lenghtly actions for nothing, 
 the latest playmaker version features a new FsmVar class that let the user select first the variable type, and then select it or feed some values, I don't have to expose ALL possibilities anymore which was confusing, prone to error and frustrations and totally messy.
 
###0.8.0
**Note:** **_Breaking Build_**. previous version had a different file organisation, so now it sits in its own folder and not within "PlayMaker" which was a mistake, 
 I assumed actions would only be detected if within the Actions folder...
 
**Note**  
- goes to 0.9 because I can :) well I had a 0.8 version sort of, but so much went that I moved to 0.9

**New**  
- New actions  

**Fix**  
- incorporate fixes for Texture and proceduralMaterial assignment  
- fixed prefab instance editing not serializing properly  
- fixed ArrayListCopyTo action  

###0.7.0

**Improvement**  
- now using gamObject for reference instead of the component itself via fsmObject, since this doesn't bring any advantages ( as we still need a string reference...)

###0.6.0  
**Note:**  
- Initial Public Release
